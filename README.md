# This is a project for the Laboratory for Atmospheric & Space Physics (LASP)
# at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU). It focuses on producing a 
# mission-long visualization of data from the
# Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft in orbit
# around the planet Mars since September of 2014, specifically from the
# Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) instrument onboard. 
# The MAVEN/IUVS data used includes over 18,000 orbits and spans
# from Martian Year 32 to 37 (Earth Year 2014 to 2023) 
# The code takes in the data and outputs a series of false-color
# images that show the globe of the planet over time.
